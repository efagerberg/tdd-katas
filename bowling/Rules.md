# Rules

A game of bowling has 10 frames
Each frame usually contains two attempts or rolls
A frame without a strike or spare has a frame score of the number of pins knocked down in that frame plus the last score.
A spare has a score of 10 + the next roll.
A frame with a strike has a frame score of 10 + the next two rolls.
A spare occurring on the last frame in the second roll results in an additional roll in order to compute the score.
A strike occurring in the first roll of the last frame results in two additional rolls in order to compute the score
