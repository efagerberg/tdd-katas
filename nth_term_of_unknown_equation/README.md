Write a function that takes a sequence of numbers and returns a new function that takes an integer and returns the nth element of the sequence.

The input sequence could not have n elements, therefore the function returned should be able to derive the pattern of the input.

In practice a sequence can be completed in many ways, assume that the equation used is a Polynomial, and find the simplest(smallest degree) equation possible, that leaves you with a single unique solution.
